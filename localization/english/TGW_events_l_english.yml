    stance.1.1.tt: "The Junkers haven't exactly changed their stances on the Austrians ever since the Brothers' War. They point to the need to finally resolve the "[SCOPE.sCulture('german_culture_scope').GetName] Question" by strong-arming the Austrians, uniting all [SCOPE.sCulture('german_culture_scope').GetName] peoples under one empire.
