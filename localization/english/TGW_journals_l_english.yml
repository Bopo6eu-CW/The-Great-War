tgw_je_regency_council_reason: "In the wake of the oath crisis and the dissolution of the Provisional Council of State, we must establish a new governing body for the occupied Polish territories. The Regency Council will serve as a semi-independent highest authority, acting as a temporary head of state for the Kingdom of Poland. This council will consist of three carefully selected members: a high-ranking [GetReligion('catholic').GetName] clergyman, a notable member of the [GetPopType('aristocrats').GetName], and a respected politician of the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_conservatives', GetPlayer).GetName].\n\nTheir task will be to oversee limited administrative powers, primarily in education and justice, while ultimately answering to our imperial interests. The Regency Council will pave the way for the eventual appointment of a monarch or regent, maintaining a semblance of Polish self-governance while securing our influence in the region. This strategic move will help manage Polish affairs more efficiently and present a more palatable face of occupation to both the local population and the international community."
