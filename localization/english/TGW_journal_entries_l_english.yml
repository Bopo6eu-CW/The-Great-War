From the Black Forest's ancient woods to the Black Sea's shining waters, our banners fly free. The old world feared change, but we embrace it. We are the Danubian Confederation, and our time has arrived!""

 tgw_occitan_question.1.d: "Over the years, our tireless efforts to bring the southern regions and hinterlands into harmony with the rest of France have borne fruit. The once-distinct cadence of Occitan speech has gradually blended into proper French, and the Breton language is all but moribund."
tgw_occitan_question.1.f: "Pierre Bonnet wiped the sweat from his brow as he finished arranging his wares in the Marseille marketplace. 'Ah, how times have changed,' he mused, overhearing a group of young people chattering in flawless Parisian French.\n\nHe remembered when his father's shop sign was written in Occitan, and customers haggled in the old tongue. Now, his own children spoke French without a trace of accent, their Occitan reduced to a handful of colorful phrases peppered into conversation.\n\nAs he called out his prices in crisp French, he felt a twinge of nostalgia, but also pride. 'We're all truly French now,' he thought, 'from Brittany to Provence.' A well-dressed Parisian approached his stall, and Pierre straightened up, ready to prove that a son of Occitania could be every bit as sophisticated as any northerner. '#italic Bonjour, monsieur, #!' he said with a smile, '#italic Avec quoi puis-je vous intéresser aujourd'hui? #!'"
