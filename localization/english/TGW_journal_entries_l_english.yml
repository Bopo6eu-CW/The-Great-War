  tgw_danube_event.1.d: "In the wake of the Revolutions of 1848, thanks to the aspirations and dedication of our statesmen, the nations along the Danube River have united under a new federal banner. The Danubian Confederation promises to safeguard the rights and cultures of its diverse peoples while harnessing their collective strength."
 tgw_danube_event.1.f: ""They called us dreamers, fools chasing a fantasy forged in the fires of revolution. For too long, our lands along the great Danube were carved up and oppressed by the old empires and kingdoms. Our cultures subjugated, our peoples divided. But no more. We have cast off the chains of the past and risen as one confederation - the Danubian peoples united at long last. From the Black Forest's ancient woods to the Black Sea's shining waters, our banners fly free. The old world feared change, but we embrace it. We are the Danubian Confederation, and our time has arrived!""
